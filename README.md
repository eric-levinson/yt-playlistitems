# Youtube Api Test

This is a small little repo dedicated to testing some of the Youtube Api funcationality. Most testing will resolve around the following:

  - Playlist
  - Playlist Items
  - Channels
  
  Many of the scripts in this repo will eventually end up being implemented in the [MBASE-Twitter-Bot](https://github.com/eric-levinson/mbase-twitter-bot) repo.

  Follow [Google's Api Install Guide](https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client#installation) for more details on setup.
